# Numerical-Methods-Calculase-Part-
This introduces several numerical methods that could be used to solve nonlinear equations and calculuse problems. 
The algorithm is written in Python.
I also write the math theory in Markdown language so you can check it easily.
Thses methods would be helpful for modeling.
