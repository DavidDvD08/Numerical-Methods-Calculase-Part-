# Numerical-Methods-Calculus-Part
This introduces several numerical methods that could be used to solve nonlinear equations and ODE problems. 
The algorithm is written in Python.
I also write the math theory in Markdown language so you can check it easily.
These methods would be helpful for modeling.
